**Expected time to complete**: 4 hours

In this chapter, we start with what is machine learning. We then discuss the system and process of machine learning. Next, we discuss the transparency of machine learning and go through a simple K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier. Finally, we list the real-world datasets to be used and machine learning models to be covered in this course, and introduce the organisation of the rest of the book.
